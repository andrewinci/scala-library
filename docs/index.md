# Scala lib template

Simple template to create a scala library.

## Use the template

- Create a new repo starting from this template
- In `build.sbt` set the `githubOwner` and the `repoName`
    ```scala
    val _repoName = "scala-library-template"
    val _githubOwner = "andrewinci"
    ```
- Make sure to have the Github token stored in the git configs (see Development)
- Try the configuration locally running `sbt test`
- Push the changes and enable the project in [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/projects/project-dashboard/github/<gitub_owner>)
- Set the env variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` in [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/settings/project/github/<gitub_owner>/<repo_name>/environment-variables) to allow publishing packages

## Features

- Munit for testing
- Scalafmt
- Publish to GH packages on tag
